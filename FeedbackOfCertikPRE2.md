## GLOBAL-01 | Financial Models

We have hired a professional financial model analysis team to monitor and analyze the operation data of our projects throughout the process.

## HNB-06 | Weak pseudo random number generator

This is our basic blind box contract. The unit price of each card is very low. If Chainlink VRF is used, the cost of our project will increase significantly, so this random number is designed to change according to the number of cards sold. Because our blind box cards will be sold very fast, they will be sold out within a few minutes, so the possibility of being attacked is very low. We will use Chainlink VRF in future advanced blind box contracts. Because the card unit price of advanced blind box is relatively high, using Chainlink VRF will not increase the cost significantly.

## HNM-04 | Logical issue of sellers

This issue has been resolved in this commit.

## HNU-04 | Weak pseudo random number generator

This is our card synthesis upgrade contract. The HC Token consumed per synthesis is not too much. If Chainlink VRF is used, it will significantly increase the cost of our project. Because the rule of synthesis upgrade is that the more cards of the same class, the more hashrate will be increased, so the influence of random numbers is very small. Even if it is attacked, the impact on the project is not too great. We will open more advanced synthetic upgrade contracts in the future. A single upgrade will consume a lot of resources. At this time, Chainlink VRF will be used, which will not significantly increase project costs.
